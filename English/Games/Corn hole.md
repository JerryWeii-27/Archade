## Game Basics

There are various ways to play the sandbag game.

In China, one common way to play is to divide the participants into two teams, with one team throwing the sandbags and the other team dodging them. The team that throws the sandbags is further divided into two groups standing at either end of the field, while the team dodging the sandbags stands in the middle. The two groups at the ends take turns throwing the sandbags at the people in the middle, and if someone is hit, they are out. If a person dodging the sandbags catches one, they get an extra life. The game continues until all the people dodging the sandbags are out, then the teams switch roles, and the game starts again.

In the West, a more common way to play involves digging a hole in the ground the size of a sandbag, or cutting a circular hole the size of a sandbag in a wooden board (as shown in the image below), and then standing at a distance trying to throw the sandbag into the hole.

## Game History

The origins of the Chinese version of the sandbag game are unclear, but the origins of the Western version are well-documented.

The game was first described in a patent for “Indoor Quoits” filed by Heyliger de Windt in 1883. This patent showcased most of the features of the modern sandbag tossing game, but with a square hole. Quoits is a game similar to horseshoes, played by throwing steel rings at a metal spike. Several early patents for “Indoor Quoits” attempted to recreate the quoits game indoors, but De Windt’s patent was the first to use sandbags and a slanted board with a hole as the target.
