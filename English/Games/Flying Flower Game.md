## Game Basics

Before playing the Flying Flower Game, a character is chosen as the theme. All lines of poetry recited must contain this character.

In ancient times, the rules for the Flying Flower Game required the responding line to match the meter of the preceding line. Additionally, there were strict requirements on the position of the chosen character within the line. These lines could be recited from existing poetry or composed on the spot.

During the game, participants could use poetry, lyrics, or prose, but the chosen lines generally did not exceed seven characters. For example, at a banquet, Player A might start with a line containing the character "flower" in the first position, such as “花近高楼伤客心” ("Flowers near the high tower grieve the guest’s heart"). Player B would then follow with a line containing "flower" in the second position, such as “落花时节又逢君” ("In the season of falling flowers, I meet you again").

Of course, the above rules are quite difficult. Therefore, modern versions of the Flying Flower Game typically simplify these rules, requiring only that the chosen character be included somewhere in the line. Sometimes, due to the difficulty of recalling lines of poetry, players decide to allow idioms, proverbs, four-character words, or even common words.

## Game History

Flying Flower Game was one of the games people played while drinking in ancient times. The loser had to drink an extra cup of wine.

Even in ancient times, the Flying Flower Game was considered one of the more elegant games, one that people without a foundation in poetry and culture could not play. Therefore, this drinking game became a favorite word game among literati and poets. The name of the Flying Flower Game originates from a famous line in Tang dynasty poet Han Hong's poem "Cold Food": "Spring city, nowhere is without flying flowers."

In modern times, the Flying Flower Game has been adapted and popularized by many Chinese variety shows. The image below is a poster for the Flying Flower Game segment of the "Chinese Poetry Conference."
