## Game Basics

Unlike normal rope jumping, long rope jumping requires a rope about 3 meters long and the joint effort of two people to swing it. During long rope jumping, two people stand a certain distance apart, pulling the rope to an appropriate length, with the middle of the rope just touching the ground being optimal.

Then, the two people swing the rope together, while the person in the middle jumps as they would in regular rope jumping.

There are various ways to play long rope jumping. The simplest method is as described above. In addition, all players can line up in a queue, jumping one by one through the swinging long rope. Although it seems that each person only needs to jump once, reducing the difficulty, smoothly entering the swinging long rope is not an easy task, especially when other people are watching and waiting for you to jump through.

Just like normal rope jumping, long rope jumping also has fancy tricks. With hands freed, the jumper has more options, adding to the fun of fancy long rope jumping.

## Game History

During the Ming Dynasty, long rope jumping was recorded in Shen Bang's "Miscellaneous Records of Wan Shu": "Using a rope about ten feet long, two children hold it at opposite ends, swinging it unpredictably, making it difficult to see clearly, as if it were a hundred ropes, but it is actually just one. A group of children take turns jumping over it as it moves, and those who successfully jump over are considered winners. Those who fail or get caught by the rope are punished by being hit by the rope holders. This game is called 'Jumping the Hundred Ropes.'"
