## Game Basics

To play cat's cradle, you need to use a medium-thickness cotton or wool string, about half a meter long. Tie the ends of the string together to form a loop.

Cat's cradle is generally a two-person game. One person uses their fingers to create a pattern with the looped string, and the other person then takes over and creates a different pattern, alternating back and forth until one person can no longer create a new pattern.

Cat's cradle game is very common across different regions and cultures worldwide. There are thousands of different patterns, some of which are quite complex. Some common patterns have specific names, such as "noodles," "bull's eye," "pretzel," and "handkerchief." The image below shows the transition from the first to the second most common pattern in cat's cradle.

The specific gameplay is quite complex and requires some memorization, but after playing several times, you should be able to remember all the patterns.
