A simple way to make a suitable iron hope is to bend the an iron sheet or copper wire into a circle with a size similar to that of a barrel mouth using a plier. The circle should not be too large or too small, and it should be made as round as possible to make rolling it easier.

The long handle can be made from a stick or bamboo whip about one meter long. It must have a U-shaped hook at the top. One convenient method is to bend a piece of wire into a the shape of a hook.

After preparing these props, the players should look for a relatively flat area that will players to roll the hoop for a long distance. 

Players hook up the handle with the iron hoop, and then walk forward. The force from their hand is exerted on hoop through the handle, causing the hoop to roll forward. The player should run behind the hoop to keep it rolling. In the end, the player should not have to use the handle to keep the hoop upright. Instead, the handle's job is to simply guide the direction of the hoop. 

However, achieving this takes practice. After enough practicing, the player would be able to control the hoop through the handle as if it is part of their body. Some players can not only make the hoop roll at high speed and take sharp corners, but also roll it backward without any hindering.
