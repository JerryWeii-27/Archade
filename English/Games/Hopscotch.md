## Game Basics

The cost of playing hopscotch is very low, and no special game materials are needed. To play, you only need a relatively flat surface, a piece of chalk or something hard enough to make marks on the ground, and a marker such as a small tile, stone, or brick.

Before starting the game, draw adjacent squares of moderate size on the ground. Each row can only have one or two squares.

After the game begins, participants decide the order of play by rock-paper-scissors. The first person throws the marker into the first square and then skips over the first square, jumping into the second square. If the first row has two squares, they jump with both feet.

After reaching the end, the player jumps up with both feet, turns around, and jumps back. When they reach the second square, they bend down to pick up the marker from the first square, then jump from the second square over the first square and out of the hopscotch grid.

Next, the player throws the marker into the second square. Starting from the first square, they skip over the second square and jump to the end, then turn around. Finally, they stand in the third square, pick up the marker, and jump over the second square, landing in the first square and then jumping out. This continues until the marker reaches the last square.

In summary, the player must avoid stepping on the square where the marker is located.

## Game History

The game of "hopscotch" originated during the Roman Empire. The original game covered a scale of 100 feet and was primarily used for the military training of Roman infantry. Later, Roman children began to imitate this military training by drawing lines and throwing stones on their own playgrounds. Subsequently, the game of "hopscotch" spread throughout Europe and gradually became a worldwide children's game.

In China, the game of "hopscotch" began during the Qing Dynasty. It not only improves children's ability to jump, run, and maintain body balance but also fosters their sense of unity, cooperation, and physical exercise.
