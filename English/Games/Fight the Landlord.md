## Game Basics

Fight the Landlord is a popular Chinese card game that involves three players - two "peasants" who team up against one "landlord." The goal is for the peasants to work together to defeat the landlord.

The game is played with a standard 54-card deck, including two jokers. Cards rank from 3 (low) to A, 2, and the two jokers (high).

The game starts with the each player being dealt 17 cards. One player, usually the one that has the 3 of spades, gets to bid on the landlord position first. In turn, players take turns bid for the landlord position by telling the other players the risk stake they are willing to accept. (In the past, players would bet money. However, betting money is considered to be illegal gambling nowadays in China.) The player with the highest bid gets the landlord position.

Players take turns playing cards, with the landlord going first. On a turn, a player must play a set of cards that is higher in rank than the previous set played. The landlord can play any valid set, while the peasants can follow suit if possible.

Here are all the valid sets, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dou_dizhu)

## Game History

The Chinese Communist Party's land reform efforts in the 1950s involved a class struggle, where peasants were encouraged to rise up against landlords. This historical context is reflected in the name of the card game "Fight the Landlord" ("dou dizhu"). However, China's younger "Generation Y" players today do not have direct personal experience of this overt class conflict.

Nowadays, the name of the game "Fight the Landlord" no longer carries the same negative connotations from that earlier period of class struggle. The actual origins of the game can be traced back to Hubei Province in China.

Although Fight the Landlord is a card game, most people in China play the game online nowadays.
