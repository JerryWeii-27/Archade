## Game Basics

To start, someone should hold all of the Mikado sticks in one hand, placing them vertically onto a flat surface, and then let go of the sticks. (In some regions of China, the game was played with popsicle sticks instead of round ones in the pictures above.) Naturally, the sticks will fall on top of each other and end up looking like the images below.

Then players in turn try to remove one single stick from the pile without touching or moving other sticks. If they do so, they get to keep the stick. In some  versions of the game, players are allowed to start with a chopstick as a helping tool. In other versions, players can only use the sticks they removed to help them.

The game continues until all the sticks have been picked up. By then, each player (hopefully everyone) should have accumulated a handful of sticks. In simpler game versions, the player holding the greatest number of sticks wins. In other versions, the sticks may have different colors, and the different colors represents different point values. Players should add up their points, and the player with the most amount of points win.

## Game History

The origins of Mikado can be traced back to ancient Europe. Then it was spread into ancient China, where it was played with bamboo slips. The game was later introduced to Japan, where it became popular among the aristocracy and was named the "game of the Mikado" or "emperor's game."

Over time, the game materials evolved from the original bamboo slips to more durable wooden, plastic, or metal sticks. However, the core gameplay of carefully removing individual sticks from a jumbled pile has remained largely unchanged since the game's earliest versions.

​The popularity of the game in China experienced a resurgence following the country's economic reforms in 1978. As more and more families emerged from extreme poverty, the demand for entertainment, particularly among children, increased. This game, which only required a few popsicle sticks to play, was a perfect fit for this growing demand.
