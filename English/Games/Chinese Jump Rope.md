## Game Basics

Chinese jump rope uses a rubber band typically around 3 meters long. Two people each hold one end of the band and stretch it out, while others take turns jumping over it. The winner is the one who completes the required moves without mistakes. If someone jumps incorrectly or fails to hook the band properly, the next person takes their turn.

There are many variations of rubber band jumping, but they all combine basic moves. The required moves are a series of these basic actions. Here are all the basic moves:

- **Preparation Move**: Stand on one side of the rubber band, between the two ends, with hands on hips or arms extended sideways. All actions begin from this position.
- **Point**: Jump in place with one foot, while the other foot jumps up and taps the ground with the ball of the foot. All basic moves start from the “point” position.
- **Step Over**: Bend one leg naturally and step over the band to the other side.
- **Press**: 
  - Front Press: Stand facing the band, lift one leg with the knee bent, and press the band with the lower leg.
  - Side Press: Stand with the left (or right) side touching the band, lift one leg with the knee bent, and press the band with the inner or outer side of the lower leg.
- **Twist**: 
  - One leg either stays in place or steps over the band to the other side, then the lower leg twists the band inward or outward multiple times.
- **Turn**: 
  - Jump while twisting around the band: One foot jumps in place, the other leg steps over the band, then the lower leg twists the band inward or outward, and you jump out while turning.
  - Alternatively, stand with both legs on one side of the band, body touching the band, and move by alternately turning left or right.
- **Pull Out**: 
  - Remove the band twisted around the leg by stepping forward or backward, depending on the direction the band is twisted. For example, if the right leg twists the band inward, step on the band with the left foot behind the right foot and pull the right foot out.
- **Press Down**: 
  - Lift one leg and press the band down with the lower leg, then tap the ground with the ball of the foot.
- **Hook Down**: 
  - Lift one leg and use the ankle to hook the band down from above head height.
- **Step and Press**: 
  - Stand on one side of the band, lift one leg and accurately step on the band from above head height. Alternatively, jump in place with one foot, step over the band with the other leg, then step on the band with both feet and move left or right.
- **Kick**: 
  - Usually performed at the third height level, hook the band down with one foot, step over the band with the other foot, and then kick the band up with the top of the foot.

## Game History

According to Wikipedia, rubber band jumping originated in China in the 7th century. Around 1960, the game spread to the West. German children call it "gummitwist," while British children refer to it as "elastics."
