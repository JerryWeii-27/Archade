## Game Basics

Unlike a regular spinning top, traditional Chinese spinning tops are much larger, heavier, and harder to spin. Unlike the spinning tops illustrated in the image below, traditional Chinese spinning tops have a relatively flat top because it is not meant to be spun by hand.

Instead, traditional Chinese spinning tops are meant to be spun through whipping it, introducing a new dimension of challenges to the seemingly simple game.

Traditional Chinese spinning tops are made of wood, bamboo, stone, ceramic, or bricks. In modern times, the wooden spinning tops often have iron nails or steel balls added to the bottom that touches the ground to reduce friction and enhance durability.

Children usually play two types of spinning top competitions.

The first type is called the "divided game". Participants are divided into two groups. Everyone spins their tops, and the group whose tops fall to the ground first loses.

The second type is called the "circle game". A large circle is drawn on the ground. Each participant takes turns spinning their own top into the circle, trying to prevent their top from escaping the circle. However, if a top stops inside the circle or falls to the ground, it is considered "dead". The owner of the top is subject to punishment by others.

## Game History

As early as the Song Dynasty in China, there was already a toy similar to a spinning top called "Qianqian." It was a needle-shaped object about three centimeters long, placed on an ivory disk. Players would spin it by hand, and the one whose top spun the longest would be the winner.

The spinning top game was popularized during the 1940s. At that time, children in old Beijing referred to whipping spinning tops as "whipping traitors." This was because the Japanese had occupied Beijing, and many Chinese people aided the Japanese, making them as hated as the Japanese invaders. Kids were said to vent their anger through the spinning top game.
