## Game Basics

3 small stones (or small cloth bags filled with sand) are scattered on the table. Pick up one stone and toss it into the air. Before it falls back onto the table, grab a second stone from the table and then catch the tossed stone. Repeat this process to grab the third stone.

If you manage to catch all three stones at the same time, toss them into the air again. Quickly flip your hand over so that the three stones land on the back of your hand. Then toss them up again and try to catch all three. If you catch them all, you win the game. If you fail to catch the tossed stones or fail to grab a stone from the table, it becomes the other player's turn. The first player to successfully complete the game wins.

If both players are highly skilled, they can use more than three stones or sandbags. Generally, using softer sandbags is easier than using stones.

## Game History

The origin of the game is unclear. However, it is recorded in the Ming Dynasty book "A Brief Sketch of Scenery in the Imperial Capital - Spring Scene" by Liu Tong and Yu Yizheng. The book describes the game as follows: "In this month, women are idle, playing with five small stones, throwing, picking up, and catching them, called 'Zhuazi'."

In Korea, this game is called "Gonggi." The image below shows the plastic stones used for playing "Gonggi."
